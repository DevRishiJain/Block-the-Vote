### Top 3 Business Metrics to Track

#### 1. Net Profit Margin

**Net Profit Margin** is an essential metric that measures how efficiently a company is converting revenue into profit. It indicates the financial health of the business and helps assess whether current practices are effective in generating profit.

**Calculation:**
$$
\text{Net Profit Margin} = \left( \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Total Revenue}} \right) \times 100
$$

**Importance:**
- Tracks overall profitability and cost management.
- Assists in comparing performance against industry benchmarks.
- Aids in making strategic decisions for future investments and cost management [citation:2][citation:4][citation:7].

#### 2. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** measures how much it costs to acquire a new customer. This metric is crucial for understanding the efficiency of marketing and sales strategies.

**Calculation:**
$$
\text{CAC} = \frac{\text{Total Marketing and Sales Spend}}{\text{Number of New Customers Acquired}}
$$

**Importance:**
- Helps determine if the company is spending efficiently to attract new customers.
- When used with Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), it helps assess the long-term profitability of acquired customers.
- Guides budget allocation for sales and marketing efforts [citation:5][citation:9].

#### 3. Gross Profit Margin

**Gross Profit Margin** represents the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It indicates how well the company is managing production costs and pricing strategies.

**Calculation:**
$$
\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \left( \frac{\text{Revenue} - \text{COGS}}{\text{Revenue}} \right) \times 100
$$

**Importance:**
- Evaluates the core profitability of products or services.
- Helps in analyzing cost structure and determining pricing strategies.
- Identifies trends in profitability over time and across different products or services [citation:4][citation:7].

By consistently monitoring these key metrics, businesses can ensure they are making data-driven decisions to enhance profitability, efficiency, and growth [citation:3][citation:5][citation:7].
