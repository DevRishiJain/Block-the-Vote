### Revenue Projections for the Next 12 Months

Using the same growth formulas, let's project the revenue at the end of 12 months:

1. **Subscription Revenue:**
   - **Future Premium Subscribers:**
     
     25 * (1 + 0.15)^12 ≈ 110 subscribers

   - **Future Monthly Subscription Revenue:**

     110 subscribers * $5 = $550

2. **SaaS Revenue:**
   - **Future Professionals Using SaaS:**

     10 * (1 + 0.10)^12 ≈ 31 professionals

   - **Future Monthly SaaS Revenue:**

     31 professionals * $100 = $3,100

3. **Advertising Revenue:**
   - **Future Ad Revenue:**

     $750 * (1 + 0.08)^12 ≈ $1,890

**Projected Total Monthly Revenue at Month 12:**

$550 (Subscriptions) + $3,100 (SaaS) + $1,890 (Advertising) = $5,540

### Cumulative Yearly Revenue:

To estimate the total revenue over the first year, we calculate the average monthly revenue and then multiply it by 12:

**Average Monthly Revenue:**

($1,875 + $5,540) / 2 = $3,707.50

**Cumulative Yearly Revenue:**

$3,707.50 * 12 = $44,490
